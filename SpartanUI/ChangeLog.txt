-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.9.6.2:
* Fixed an issue with the left and right back drops not staying hidden after a relog or reloadui
* Added support for 2K Ultra Wide Monitors (3440 x 1440)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.9.6.1:
* Possible fix for an issue with the BuffToggle. When off the Target frame seems to not update properly. Removed some code that wasn't needed in the BuffToggle checks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.9.6:
* Added the ability to hide/show the (leftbackground & Bar5). New command /spartanui leftbackground hide or /spartanui leftbackground show

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.9.5:
* Fixed an issue with the Popup bars. There was a bug that prevented you from always showing the bars so the "off" setting was broken.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.9.4:
* Fixed an issue with users not able to individually select party members. This also affected the RightClick menu and cast macros.
* Added a /sui menu toggle to disable AutoUI Resize for those users who are running in a resolution lower than 1920 x 1080 (Wide).
* Modified Adapt to ONLY animate the Self, Target and Party frames unless specifically toggled by the user via the /adapt menu.
	(Note: I'd advise against this since Adapt doesn't seem to properly crop portraits embedded in other frames.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.3:
* Fixed an issue with Zone/Instance/Boat/Taxi causing action bars to disappear

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.9.2:
* Fixed an issue with the cast bar. Interrupted channeled spells would continue to animate the cast bar. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.9.1:
* Fixed party frames Rage, Energy and Focus bars. They were assigned the wrong anchor points in the XML resulting in them appearing over the health bar.

* Adjusted Party1, 2, 3, 4 frames and spaced them further apart - they were previously too close and appeared squished. 

* Reduced the portrait sizes to make them appear more centered in the unit frames

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.9:
* Initial release
